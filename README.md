# Ternary-NanoCore
  Verilog implementation of a Ternary Matrix Multiplication Unit (TMU) optimized for Artix-7, leveraging architectural concepts from the TerEffic paper (Pre-computed negation & 1.6-bit compression).



This FPGA design for ternary LLM inference is inspired by TerEffic 
(Yin et al., 2025, arXiv:2502.16473v2), licensed under CC BY 4.0. 
I adapted their 1.6-bit weight compression scheme and modified 
the TMat Core for my specific hardware constraints.
